<h1>WebstarauntStore Coding Exercise</h1>

<p>This is a simple <code>Maven/Java</code> project that includes class implementations and Unit tests for a <code>Product</code> class and a <code>StoreInventory</code> class that includes a list of products. Each <code>Product</code> has a unique ID, name, price and quantity. </p>
The <code>StoreInventory</code> class has the ability to do the following:
<ul>
  <li>Add a new product to the inventory</li>
  <li>Remove a product based on its unique ID</li>
  <li>Update the quantity of a product</li>
  <li>View the current inventory</li>
  <li>Calculate the total value of the products in the inventory</li>
</ul>

Unit tests were written with ```JUnit``` and cover the implementations of the ```Product``` and ```StoreInventory``` classes.
